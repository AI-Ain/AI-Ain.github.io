# Data science portfolio by Dileep.A (AMAN)

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. 

## AN APPROACH FOR TABLE SCRAPING - AZURE FORM RECOGNIZER

Invoice handling is the most important task in many different fields that deal with large amounts of data in many different formats. Tables use layouts to organize information and convey meaning and can also represent and communicate complex information to readers.

The link can be found [here](https://medium.com/@dileepdba1988/an-approaach-for-table-scraping-with azure-form-recognizer-f34ffc69b169).

## Stand-alone projects.

### Home Credit Default Risk

Home Credit Bank offers a challenge of credit scoring. There is a lot of data about applicants and their previous behavior. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/dileepshaik/Bank-CST-Data).

## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Azure ML Studio](https://gallery.azure.ai/Home/Author?authorId=B34E16909B14D3F008F1BA7ECA1B12F9E8F01F764DAA7F48955BDC6392FE8FC1).

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

## Regression problems.

### Loan Prediction

[Github](https://github.com/AI-Ain/AI-Ain.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Loan_Prediction.ipynb) 


Loan Prediction is a knowledge and learning hackathon on Analyticsvidhya. Dream Housing Finance company deals in home loans. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. Based on customer's information we predict whether they should receive a loan or not. 

## Natural language processing.

### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn

[Github](https://github.com/AI-Ain/AI-Ain.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb) 

Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.

### NLP. Text summarization

[Github](https://github.com/AI-Ain/AI-Ain.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Summarize.ipynb) 
This notebook shows how text can be summarized choosing several most important sentences from the text. I explore various methods of doing this based on a news article.

## Clustering

### Clustering with KMeans

[Github](https://github.com/AI-Ain/AI-Ain.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb) 

Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. Clustering with KMeans is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works. Data used is about various types of seeds and their parameters. 


## Data exploration and analysis

### Telematic data

[Github](https://github.com/AI-Ain/AI-Ain.github.io/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb)

I have a dataset with telematic information about 10 cars driving during one day. I visualise data, search for insights and analyse the behavior of each driver. I can't share the data, but here is the notebook. I want to notice that folium map can't be rendered by native github, but nbviewer.jupyter can do it.

## Recommendation systems.

### Collaborative filtering

[Github](https://github.com/AI-Ain/AI-Ain.github.io/master/Notebooks/Collaborative_filtering.ipynb)

Recommenders are systems, which predict ratings of users for items. There are several approaches to build such systems and one of them is Collaborative Filtering. 
This notebook shows several examples of collaborative filtering algorithms.


### Handwritten digit recognition

This is my own project using image recognition methods in practice. This is a site (also works on mobile) where user can draw a digit, and machine learning models (FNN and CNN) will try to recognize it. After than models can use the drawn digit for training to improve their accuracy. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/Erlemar/digit-draw-recognize).


## Anomaly Detection

[Github] (https://github.com/dileepshaik/MEDIUM_NoteBook)

Repository contains the notebooks of multiole methods to detect the anomalies in the dataset.
